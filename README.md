# 🔍 Legal Search with Explanations

A powerful Streamlit web application for semantic search over legal documents with AI-generated explanations. This app combines state-of-the-art embedding models, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, neural reranking, and LLM-based explanations to help users efficiently find and understand relevant legal provisions.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a semantic legal document search system featuring:

- **Ollama Embeddings:** Uses Ollama's `"nomic-embed-text"` model to convert legal text into semantic vectors.
- **ChromaDB ANN Search:** Employs ChromaDB for fast approximate nearest neighbor retrieval with optimized HNSW indexing.
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking:** Applies a dense cross-encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) for refining initial results.
- **LLaMA 2 LLM Explanation Generation:** Calls Ollama's LLM (`llama2:latest`) to generate concise, human-readable explanations for each search result on demand.
- **Streamlit UI:** Interactive, clean interface with query input, configurable top-k results, rerank scoring, and explanation display.

---

## 🔎 Features

- **Efficient Embedding & Index Caching:** Uses Streamlit's `@st.cache_resource` decorator to avoid repeated embedding computation and index rebuilding across sessions.
- **Batch Processing with Progress Bar:** Shows real-time progress during initial embedding and indexing.
- **Configurable Top-K Results:** Adjustable slider to control number of displayed and reranked results.
- **On-Demand Explanation Generation:** Explanations by LLM are generated only when users request them, ensuring responsiveness.
- **Streamlined UI with Styling:** Displays cosine distances, rerank scores, legal metadata (`act` and `section`), documents excerpts, and AI-generated explanations in a visually appealing manner.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Legal researchers and practitioners seeking semantically relevant excerpts from legal text.
- Developers exploring how to combine semantic search, neural reranking, and LLM explanation generation.
- Organizations wanting explainable AI-powered legal search to enhance workflows.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Reads legal documents from `bns.csv` (with `description`, `act`, and `section` columns).
2. **Embedding Generation:** Uses Ollama’s embedding model to convert documents into vector representations.
3. **Indexing:** Builds an ANN index in ChromaDB optimized with HNSW parameters.
4. **Query Processing:** Retrieves candidate documents based on vector similarity.
5. **Reranking:** Applies a Cross-Encoder model to reorder candidate results by refined relevance score.
6. **Explanation Generation:** On user request, generates a concise relevance explanation per result using Ollama’s LLaMA 2 model.
7. **Display:** Presents results with metadata, similarity scores, reranking, and explanations.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Python packages:
  - `streamlit`
  - `pandas`
  - `chromadb`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `requests`
  - `numpy`
- Ollama server running locally or accessible remotely with:

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dhaneshdalal2/Rag_based_LLM.git
    cd Rag_based_LLM
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install streamlit pandas chromadb sentence-transformers requests numpy
    ```

3. Ensure Ollama server is running at the configured API URL (`http://localhost:11434/api` by default) with the required models loaded.

4. Place your `bns.csv` file in the root directory. The file should contain legal document descriptions and metadata (`act`, `section`, `description`).

## 🚀 Running the App

Launch the Streamlit app with:

streamlit run app.py


- Enter your legal query in the input area.
- Adjust the "Number of top results" slider.
- Click "Run Semantic Search" to retrieve and rerank relevant legal documents.
- Click "Show Explanation" on any result to generate a concise AI explanation of relevance.
